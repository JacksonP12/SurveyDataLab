# SurveyDataLab

From the analyses that I've done in this lab, I've learned about how the median 538 partisan voting index for state legislature district (essentially, how Republican or Democrat any states' given state legislature maps are). Some states will be more Republican or Democratic than others, but the interesting part is when comparing the change of the median PVI from the pre-2020 census maps to the post-2020 census ones. Most stayed rather similar, such as Oregon's, which shifted more Democratic by about 0.5 points, but some states had very large shifts, such as Texas' maps, whose median state legislature district became almost 10 points more Republican.
In terms of what I learned independently, I found out generally some more stuff about the pandas python library, specifically about how to change the row indexes without the use of the groupby function. I also learned how to subtract different lists from each other (using the enumerate() function).
